*Overall, you have a solid conceptual setup presented here that I think should be very doable for the course project. Right now, it is important to get things down into code or at the very least pseudocode as quickly as possible to make sure that you have something running and enough results to present in April. You've got a lot of implementation, debugging, and analysis ahead of you, and you'll want to make sure to leave enough time to get through all of that.*

*One big thing you will need to make sure to do is to think deeply about your state transition probabilities, and especially if they will be depending on either repeat exposures and/or multiple exposures from different individuals. I anticipate that this will end up driving a lot of your dynamics. Also, playing around with different network structures and different initializations of what your population looks like in terms of their states will be important as well.*

*If you have any questions or find yourself running into any issues, please let me know and we can work through it.*
